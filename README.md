# Electroneum Vendor Payment Widget

Our Instant Payment Vendor Payment Widget allows you to generate a
QR code online; suitable for e-commerce websites.

You can sign up for an Electroneum user account at
[my.electroneum.com/register](https://my.electroneum.com/register) and
apply for a vendor account at
[my.electroneum.com/user/vendor](https://my.electroneum.com/user/vendor).

## Status

This project is currently in BETA phase. During this phase, we accept no
responsibility for any false notifications nor affirm the identity of
any vendors.

There is a maximum spend limit of â‚¬50.00 per transaction; this figure
is converted to ETN at a regular interval based on market data. Please
do not try to present a QR code to users above this limit as the
transaction will fail.

## Support

Community support is available at
[community.electroneum.com](https://community.electroneum.com/c/api-developers).

## Documentation

Further documentation on data structures (useful to create your own
integration or to create the QR code yourself) and our Vendor API can
be found at [https://community.electroneum.com/t/using-the-etn-instant-payment-api/121](https://community.electroneum.com/t/using-the-etn-instant-payment-api/121).

## Requirements

You must have already generated your payment string containing your
vendor address, payment id and ETN amount.

The payment string structure, detailed in the link above, is:

```
{vendor-address}/{payment-id}/{amount}
```

## Download

You can download the latest version of this project from
[github.com/electroneum/vendor-payment-widget](https://github.com/electroneum/vendor-payment-widget).

## Installation

Unpack the minified javascript file from `src/` and include it in your
HTML. For example:

```html
<script src="js/etn.vendor-widget-0.1.0.min.js"></script>
```

## Quick Use

Once you have your payment string (see the documentation link above),
you simply include this in a `data-etn-vendor` attribute of a `div`. For
example:

```html
<div data-etn-vendor="etn-it-0abc123def456/7ce25b4dc0/1234.56"></div>
```

On page load, the Javascript file will replace this div with a scannable
and clicking QR code.
